# Ask Ernie

Ask Ernie is an application that fills out masked queries using [distillbert](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html).

If you ask Ernie:

    "Hello, This is Farmer Ernie. You might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the [MASK]?"

You'll receive a range of responses like:

    hello, this is farmer ernie. you might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the woods?
    hello, this is farmer ernie. you might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the desert?
    hello, this is farmer ernie. you might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the rain?
    hello, this is farmer ernie. you might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the city?
    hello, this is farmer ernie. you might wonder why a city kid like me is doing out here in the dark?

Where Ernie has predicted the word that replaces the `[MASK]` symbol.

## Running ernie

```

## Take-home assignment

Ask Ernieâ„¢ has grown to be quite a popular service.

In order to scale our model, we would like you to modify ernie so that requests
to the server are queued using [NATS](https://nats.io/), and serviced by a pool
of workers in the background.

Each worker should listen for messages published on NATS, and respond with the
output from the model that is currently in `ernie/ernie.py`, which should
be returned as a response to the client.

You should be able to start multiple worker processes so that messages on the
queue are divided up among a number of workers.

### Running NATS

NATS can be run as a standalone Docker container using the following invocation

``` shell
docker run -p 4222:4222 nats
```
